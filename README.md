2 AI Wrappers that do very basic functions. One is available at um-mepel.github.io. The other can only be accessed through building a local host. 

To run the local host:
1. make a .env file with the text "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk..[this should be your actual openai key]"
2. in the terminal, type "make server_2" to the backend
3. in the terminal, type "export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk..[this should be your actual openai key]" to set your api key without putting it in code
4. in the terminal, type "./server_2" to run the code
5. Cmd-Click on the link for local host
