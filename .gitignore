#    NEVER commit these files, even if they are only used for local testing.

This `.gitignore` file is now saved for your project.

**Remember:**

1.  Save this content as a file named **`.gitignore`** (note the leading dot) in the root of your project directory.
2.  Make sure you commit this file to Git:
    ```bash
    git add .gitignore
    git commit -m "Added .gitignore for security"
    git push
    ```
3.  **Crucially:** Never place your actual `OPENAI_API_KEY` directly into any file that is *not* listed here (like `server.cpp` or `index.html`) or push it to your repository. It must be set as an **environment variable** during the cloud deployment process.
